#Python Variable Name Rules
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (firstname, Firstname, FirstName and FIRSTNAME) are different variables)

#creating a variable 

x=30
y="kunal"

print(x)
print(y)

#variable casting 

x=str(3)
y=int(3)
z=float(4)

print(x,y,z) #we can print multiple variable in one time 

x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'

#declraring multiple variable in one line 

first_name, last_name='kunal','adkine'
print(first_name)
print(last_name)
